The Integration Service is defined as a middle-ware layer serving back-end integration between the EJAR platform and the Saudi Electricity Company (SEC).

Objective: The service is designed to assure there are no account receivables or any outstanding items at any given Contract Account associated with the SEC customer involved in any active rental relation within EJAR.

Roles: SEC is the Service Provider that offers and maintains the underlying integration service, while EJAR is the Service Requester that consumes these services or functions (operations).

Context: These functions are essential for managing the transfer of electricity service liability between the owner/lessor and the tenant during the contract duration.

Detailed Integration Service Functions (Operations)

The EJAR platform consumes six main operations provided by SEC through the Integration Service:

1. Premise Check (Operation 1)
This operation is used by EJAR to verify the validity of premise details.
• Function: It validates the premise details, including the meter number, national address, and the owner and tenant details for permitted residential and commercial usage categories based on the provided Premise ID

• Limitation: The current version of this operation is limited to single-meter installations

2. Tenant Stumble Check (Operation 2)
This operation is crucial for checking the tenant's financial eligibility before initiating a new contract.
• Function: It returns information about the tenant’s obstacles (or "stumbles") as extracted from SEC’s SAP IS-U system, based on the tenant’s identity
• Key Output: It provides the Total due balance (which represents all overdue balances for the customer) and a list of Contract Accounts assigned to the given National ID in SEC

3. Meter Reading Plausibility Check (Operation 3)
This ensures the accuracy of meter readings provided during the contract handover.
• Function: It returns the plausibility of the electricity meter reading provided by the customer. This check is only applicable for non-smart meters (Dumb Meters)
• Plausibility Result: In cases where the provided meter reading is implausible or missing, the operation returns the expected reading proposed by SEC’s SAP IS-U system
• EJAR Requirement: EJAR must use this operation to validate the meter reading during any entry (Move-In) or exit (Move-Out) of the tenant

4. Tenant Move-In (Operation 4)
This is the core operation for liability assignment at the start of a tenancy.
• Function: It transfers the electricity service liability from the owner/lessor to the tenant in SEC’s SAP IS-U system
• Purpose: By executing this, SEC is enabled to issue the new bills under the tenant’s name
• Trigger: It is triggered by a Move-In request within EJAR during the rental contract Issuing or Re-Issuing, or for existing contracts where liability transfer is involved
• Output: The operation returns a Reference Number for the Move-In process generated by SAP IS-U within SEC

5. Tenant Move-Out (Operation 5)
This operation concludes the tenant's liability for the electricity service.
• Function: It transfers the electricity service liability back from the tenant to the owner/lessor
• Trigger: It is triggered by EJAR when a rental contract is expired, terminated, or based on an on-demand Move-Out request
• Constraint: A Move-Out request can only be triggered by EJAR for those requests for which the Move-In request was originally initiated through EJAR

6. Ejar Notification (Operation 6)
This function allows EJAR to keep SEC records up-to-date throughout the contract lifespan.
• Function: It enables EJAR to notify SEC of any updates in the existing Tenant’s Contract or changes of ownership.
• Updates Supported: The notification is categorized by specific identifiers (e.g., BR001, BR002, BR003, BR005) corresponding to events such as Change Owner, Change Lessor (Lessor representative), Change Owner/Lessor, and Contract Renewal

More technical details will be shared later about the SEC APIs.
